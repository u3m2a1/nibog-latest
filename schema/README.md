# NIBOG Platform Schema Documentation

This folder contains the database schema definitions for the NIBOG Platform. The schema is designed to support both the user-facing application and the admin panel, with integration to n8n for workflow automation and Postgres for data storage.

## Files Organization

The schema is organized into the following files:

1. **core-schema.md** - Core entities like Users, Children, Events, and Bookings
2. **auth-schema.md** - Authentication and authorization related schemas
3. **content-schema.md** - Content-related schemas like Testimonials, FAQs, and static content
4. **admin-schema.md** - Admin-specific schemas for analytics, reporting, and management

## Database Design Considerations

The schema is designed with the following considerations:

1. **High Traffic Handling** - Optimized for handling 5000 concurrent bookings
2. **n8n Integration** - Compatible with n8n workflow automation
3. **Postgres Compatibility** - Designed for PostgreSQL database
4. **Scalability** - Structured to allow for horizontal scaling
5. **Performance** - Indexed fields and optimized relationships for fast queries

## Implementation Notes

When implementing this schema in PostgreSQL, consider the following:

1. Use appropriate indexing strategies for frequently queried fields
2. Implement connection pooling for handling high concurrency
3. Consider partitioning large tables (like bookings) for better performance
4. Implement proper foreign key constraints for data integrity
5. Use PostgreSQL-specific features like JSONB for flexible data storage where appropriate
